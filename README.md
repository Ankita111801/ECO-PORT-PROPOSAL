# 🌿 Sustainable Port Infrastructure – CreaTech by L&T (Feb–Mar 2025)

## 🛳️ Project Overview

This project was submitted as part of the national-level **CreaTech Innovation Challenge by L&T** under the theme of **Sustainable Port Infrastructure**. Our team from MANIT Bhopal proposed a comprehensive eco-port model integrating renewable energy, AI-driven logistics, carbon capture systems, and smart automation—targeting decarbonization, improved efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

## 🔧 Key Features of the Proposal

### ✅ Eco-Friendly Construction
- **Geopolymer Concrete** – Reduces CO₂ emissions by 50–80%.
- **Recycled Materials** – Includes crushed concrete, rubber, and plastic.
- **Sustainable Steel and Bamboo** – Earthquake-resistant, durable materials.
- **Graphene-Based Coatings** – Extends infrastructure lifespan.

### 🌊 Floating Jetties
- **No seabed excavation** – Protects marine ecosystems.
- **Wave-resistant and modular** – Adaptable to future expansion.
- **Materials** – M45 concrete, GGBS cement, EPS floatation cores.

### 🛠️ Eco-Dredging Technologies
- Low-impact dredging with real-time water quality tracking.
- Beneficial reuse of dredged material (e.g., beach nourishment).
- Inspired by Fincantieri’s LIMPIDH2O® system.

### 🤖 Automation and AI Logistics
- **AI-powered cargo scheduling** – Reduces turnaround time.
- **IoT & Digital Twins** – Real-time port operations monitoring.
- **Robotic Cargo Handling** – Minimizes manual labor and errors.

### ⚡ Shore Power (Cold Ironing)
- Ships plug into the port's power supply, reducing fuel use and emissions.
- Complies with IMO emission norms and cuts noise pollution.

### 🧪 Carbon Capture Systems
- Amine-based and adsorption-based CO₂ capture from flue gases.
- Safe compression and underground storage of liquefied CO₂.

### 🌞 Renewable Energy + Smart Systems
- Hybrid solar and wave energy systems with battery storage.
- Electrification of port equipment and vehicles.
- LNG bunkering, EV charging, green hydrogen use.

### 🌿 Environmental & Circular Measures
- 100% wastewater recycling and ecosystem protection.
- Annual environmental audits and carbon credit incentives.
